# pebble-fit
Become less sedentary with pebble

# Getting Started (CloudPebble)
1. Go to https://cloudpebble.net
2. Go to the PROJECTS tab and hit IMPORT. Choose IMPORT FROM GITHUB. Give it a name (e.g. pebble-fit), set GITHUB PROJECT to https://github.com/snap-stanford/pebble-fit, **set BRANCH to cloudpebble**, select USE AS GIT REMOTE, and then click IMPORT
3. Ensure you have the pebble App installed. In the App, enable developer connections. Make sure the watch is running the new 4.0 version.
4. Go to the COMPILATION page on the sidebar. Hit RUN BUILD. After it is built successfully, select PHONE and then hit INSTALL AND RUN. Make sure your phone is connected to WiFi and paired to your watch.

# Issues
1. On CloudPebble, cannot set PULL CHANGES to "Automatically". Have to pull manually by clicking PULL LATEST COMMIT in the GITHUB setting page to get the latest commit from GitHub.
